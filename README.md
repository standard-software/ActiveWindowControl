Snap Left / Right in the root part of the menu moves the window to the left or right with a width of 50%.

Each menu in Snap Window determines the window size by the ratio of the screen size.

Left / Right determines the width by the specified ratio and snaps the window.

Top / Bottom determines the height by the specified ratio and snaps the window.

Top Left and other corner snaps determine the width and height by the specified ratio and snap the window.

Screen Center / Horizontal Center / Vertical Center also determine the width and height and move to the screen position.

### Display

![](README/README_2025-02-06_01-01-46.png)

The Display menu allows you to move screens around.

This menu appears when you are using two or more displays.

Displays are sorted from left to right, up to down. (The order does not match the numbering of the Windows settings.)

The main display is the Screen Center.
The one on the left will be labeled Screen Left / Screen Left Up / Screen Left Down, etc.

The window displaying the current application is disabled because it is not the target of the move.

Same Position allows you to move to another display while maintaining the current window's proportionate position on the display.

Snap and Fit are for the target display, respectively.
